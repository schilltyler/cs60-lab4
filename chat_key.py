key_exchange.py -- Part 2: Secret key generation by rapid RSSI exchange.

Usage (example):
  sudo python3 chat_key.py --iface wlan0 --n 300 --listen 2 --per-index-timeout 0.5

Notes:
 - Interface must be in monitor mode on the same channel on both devices.
 - You must run the same program on both devices; they auto-elect roles.
 - The script writes two files at exit:
    initiator_samples.json and responder_samples.json
   containing { index: rssi } pairs observed by each device.
